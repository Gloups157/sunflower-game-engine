# sunflower-game-engine
Personal game engine, developed in C++, with the aim of having an ECS with simple-to-use systems and built-in components, enabling good game architecture (Event Bus, different state machines, etc.). The engine also abstracts the APIs for graphics (OpenGL for now, but Vulkan later), windows, inputs (GLFW, SDL, etc.).
